### By Brodie Hunt

## Purpose

The purpose of building this Portfolio website was to demonstrate my abilities in html and CSS to potential employers. It is also the purpose of the website to showcase other material that would demonstrate my competence in programming, and provide an elegent display of this material. From an Academic perspective, this portfolio was used to test and expand my knowledge with the html and css format.

## Functionality/Features

   This website contains pages that feature a home, about me, projects, and blog page. All pages an features applied within this website aim to be 100% repsonsive and adaptable. 

#### Home page

- The home page is a simple page that introduces you to who I am. From the home page, you can follow the flow of the website and click on the 'discover me' button to be moved to the 'about-me' page, or navigate using the dropdown menu when clicking the hamburger item. 

#### Website flow/Navigation

The website is designed to have a story like flow as you move through each page, with buttons that prompt you to move onto another page once the consumer has absorbed all the content. Otherwise, the user can always navigate throughout the website using the main dropdown menu. The logo in the top left is also a home button. All navigationl buttons have a background color transitional event to prompt user engagement. 

#### About Me Page

The about me page features a picture of myself accompying a small description in order to give the website some personal character and show potential employeers what I enjoy, and who I am as a person. This page also has a 'Passions' feature which collates pictures of all the things I like doing. This feature is styled to enhance user experience. 

#### Projects Page

This page is the most crucial page for potential employeers to see as it holds content from 6 individual projects. Each Project is displayed with a title, image, and description of how the project was completed and what it entailed. Each project also contains a button that will link to my github repository for that relevent project. At the bottom of this page there are two small features. One that links my resume, and GitHub. The other prompts the user to move onto the blog page when they are ready. 

#### Blog Page

The first feature on this page is a collection of recent posts with a relevant picture and title. Each one of these containers has an anchor link that will take the user to the corresponding blog post on the page. These recent posts will be displayed in an horizontally scrolling element. There are 5 blogs on this page. Each blog contains a title, timestamp, link to twitter or facebook, an image and the blog text.
